# todoListe
A simple and responsive to-do list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently by adding, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.
